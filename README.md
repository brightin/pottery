# Pottery

A library to use GNU Gettext as translation solution for clojure projects. This small library is meant to extract translatable strings from your codebase, generate a PO Template file and parsing PO (translation) files.

## Why Gettext

TODO

## Installation

Add this dependency to your project:

``` clojure
[brightin/pottery "0.0.1"]
```

And require it:

``` clojure
(require '[pottery.core :as pottery])
```

## Basic usage

### 1. Scan your codebase

Call the scan function from the REPL:

``` clojure
(pottery/scan-codebase!)
```

This will scan the codebase for any translatable strings and write the PO template file to `resources/gettext/template.pot`.

See below for more configurations of the scanner.

### 2. Use tools to generate translation files

For every string in the codebase there needs to be a translation to other languages. These get written in `<lang>.po` files. There are various tools available to achieve this. The most popular and recomended one would the free GUI tool [Poedit](https://poedit.net/). Use Poedit to load the PO template file and generate the translation files, and interactively translate all the strings.

### 3. Parse the translation files

With those translation files generated from step 2, Pottery can scan those files into a map from `{"Original String" "Translated string"}`.

``` clojure
(pottery/read-po-file (io/resource "gettext/<lang>.po"))
;; => {"Original string" "Translated string in <lang>"}
```

### 4. Repeat!

Whenever strings change in the codebase, at will re-scan c.f. step 1. This will replace the old template file, ensuring changed strings are changed, and removed strings are removed. Then merge that new template file in the translation files from step 2. In Poedit you can achieve this by going to *Catalog -> Update from POT file*. When you save in Poedit you can also purge deleted strings from the po file via *Catalog -> Purge Deleted Translations*. You translation files are now in sync!
